### 1. Command Registration

- **Score**: MoSCoW Must Have
- **Framework**: MoSCoW (Must Have)
- **Rationale**: Dependency root of the CLI Skeleton — every other capability requires it, so it builds first. Highest leverage at zero dependency cost.
- **Status**: specified:001-command-registration

### 2. Argument Dispatch

- **Score**: MoSCoW Must Have
- **Framework**: MoSCoW (Must Have)
- **Rationale**: Builds on Command Registration and sits on the critical path to Exit-Code Convention, so it precedes the parallelizable Help & Version.
- **Dependencies**: → requires: Command Registration
- **Status**: specified:002-argument-dispatch

### 3. Help & Version

- **Score**: MoSCoW Must Have
- **Framework**: MoSCoW (Must Have)
- **Rationale**: Builds on Command Registration but is off the critical path (nothing depends on it), so it follows Argument Dispatch; the two are parallelizable.
- **Dependencies**: → requires: Command Registration
- **Status**: specified:003-help-and-version

### 4. Exit-Code Convention

- **Score**: MoSCoW Must Have
- **Framework**: MoSCoW (Must Have)
- **Rationale**: End of the dependency chain — needs Argument Dispatch in place to emit standardized exit codes, so it builds last.
- **Dependencies**: → requires: Argument Dispatch
- **Status**: specified:004-exit-code-convention

### 5. Credential Discovery

- **Score**: MoSCoW Must Have
- **Framework**: MoSCoW (Must Have)
- **Rationale**: Dependency root of Token Authentication — Request Authentication can't resolve a token without it, so it builds first in the auth solution. Builds on the CLI Skeleton (not a declared FEATURE-MODEL edge).
- **Status**: specified:005-credential-discovery

### 6. Credential Storage

- **Score**: MoSCoW Must Have
- **Framework**: MoSCoW (Must Have)
- **Rationale**: Independent of Credential Discovery (writes the file Discovery reads); off the critical path within the solution, so it parallelizes with #5. The login command builds on the CLI Skeleton (not a declared FEATURE-MODEL edge).
- **Status**: specified:006-credential-storage

### 7. Request Authentication

- **Score**: MoSCoW Must Have
- **Framework**: MoSCoW (Must Have)
- **Rationale**: Proves identity on each API call; builds after Credential Discovery, which it consumes the resolved token from. Gates every self-service read (#9–#12).
- **Dependencies**: → requires: Credential Discovery
- **Status**: specified:007-request-authentication

### 8. Connection Resolution

- **Score**: MoSCoW Must Have
- **Framework**: MoSCoW (Must Have)
- **Rationale**: Completes the client foundation — resolves the base URL + token into the connection context every API call needs, so it precedes the self-service reads. Sibling of Request Authentication (both consume Credential Discovery); orderable in either position relative to #7.
- **Dependencies**: → requires: Credential Discovery
- **Status**: pending

### 9. Identity Read

- **Score**: MoSCoW Must Have
- **Framework**: MoSCoW (Must Have)
- **Rationale**: The smallest end-to-end read that proves the whole chain (`GET /me` → `getMe`); the spec calls it the first call a consumer makes to orient itself, so it leads the read surface. Parallelizable with #10–#12 (no inter-read dependency).
- **Dependencies**: → requires: Request Authentication
- **Status**: pending

### 10. My Roles

- **Score**: MoSCoW Must Have
- **Framework**: MoSCoW (Must Have)
- **Rationale**: Named in the ROADMAP Now slice ("/me, my roles"), so it follows Identity Read; the chain is already proven, making this an extension. Parallelizable with the other reads.
- **Dependencies**: → requires: Request Authentication
- **Status**: pending

### 11. My Actions

- **Score**: MoSCoW Must Have
- **Framework**: MoSCoW (Must Have)
- **Rationale**: Extends the "what's mine" surface beyond the proven slice; no dependency on the other reads, so its position reflects priority, not build order.
- **Dependencies**: → requires: Request Authentication
- **Status**: pending

### 12. My Projects

- **Score**: MoSCoW Must Have
- **Framework**: MoSCoW (Must Have)
- **Rationale**: Completes the "what's mine" surface; last of the parallelizable reads by priority, with no inter-read dependency.
- **Dependencies**: → requires: Request Authentication
- **Status**: pending
